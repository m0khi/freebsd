/*
 * Multi-producer safe lock-free ring buffer enqueue
 *
 * Most architectures do not support the atomic update of multiple
 * discontiguous locations. So it is not possible to atomically update
 * the producer index and ring buffer entry. To side-step this limitation
 * we split update in to 3 steps:
 *      1) atomically acquiring an index
 *      2) updating the corresponding ring entry
 *      3) making the update available to the consumer
 * In order to split the index update in to an acquire and release
 * phase there are _two_ producer indexes. 'prod_head' is used for
 * step 1) and is thus only used by the enqueue itself. 'prod_tail'
 * is used for step 3) to signal to the consumer that the update is
 * complete. To guarantee memory ordering the update of 'prod_tail' is
 * done with a atomic_store_rel_32(...) and the corresponding
 * initial read of 'prod_tail' by the dequeue functions is done with
 * an atomic_load_acq_32(...).
 *
 * Regarding memory ordering - there are five variables in question:
 * (br_) prod_head, prod_tail, cons_head, cons_tail, ring[idx={cons, prod}]
 * It's easiest examine correctness by considering the consequence of
 * reading a stale value or having an update become visible prior to
 * preceding writes.
 *
 * - prod_head: this is only read by the enqueue routine, if the latter were to
 *   initially read a stale value for it the cmpxchg (atomic_cmpset_acq_32)
 *   would fail. However, the implied memory barrier in cmpxchg would cause the
 *   subsequent read of prod_head to read the up-to-date value permitting the
 *   cmpxchg to succeed the second time.
 *
 * - prod_tail: This value is used by dequeue to determine the effective
 *   producer index. On architectures with weaker memory ordering than x86 it
 *   needs special handling. In enqueue it needs to be updated with
 *   atomic_store_rel_32() (i.e. a write memory barrier before update) to
 *   guarantee that the new ring value is committed to memory before it is
 *   made available by prod_tail. In dequeue to guarantee that it is read before
 *   br_ring[cons_head] it needs to be read with atomic_load_acq_32().
 *
 * - cons_head: this value is used only by dequeue, it is either updated
 *   atomically (dequeue_mc) or protected by a mutex (dequeue_sc).
 *
 * - cons_tail: This is used to communicate the latest consumer index between
 *   dequeue and enqueue. Reading a stale value in enqueue can cause an enqueue
 *   to fail erroneously. To avoid a load being re-ordered after a store (and
 *   thus permitting enqueue to store a new value before the old one has been
 *   consumed) it is updated with an atomic_store_rel_32() in deqeueue.
 *
 * - ring[idx] : Updates to this value need to reach memory before the subsequent
 *   update to prod_tail does. Reads need to happen before subsequent updates to
 *   cons_tail.
 *
 * Some implementation notes:
 * - Much like a simpler single-producer single consumer ring buffer,
 *   the producer can not produce faster than the consumer. Hence the
 *   check of 'prod_head' + 1 against 'cons_tail'.
 *
 * - The use of "prod_next = (prod_head + 1) & br->br_prod_mask" to
 *   calculate the next index is slightly cheaper than a modulo but
 *   requires the ring to be power-of-2 sized.
 *
 * - The critical_enter() / critical_exit() are not required for
 *   correctness. They prevent updates from stalling by having a producer be
 *   preempted after updating 'prod_head' but before updating 'prod_tail'.
 *
 * - The "while (br->br_prod_tail != prod_head)"
 *   check assures in order completion (probably not strictly necessary,
 *   but makes it easier to reason about) and allows us to update
 *   'prod_tail' without a cmpxchg / LOCK prefix.
